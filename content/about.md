## About me

I'm Lukas, or jemus42, or jemsu, or whatever.  
My home on the internet is either my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/jemus42) and [Mastodon account](https://cybre.space/@jemus42) respectively, or this [tumblr I still have for some reason](https://quantenbrot.de).  

I'm primarily interested in tv shows, data analysis and being socially awkward.  
If you want to contact me, I really wouldn't know why, but you can try `jemus42@quantenbrot.de`

## This Site

This is made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), using [my fork](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-redlounge-jemsu) of the [Red Lounge theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/redlounge/) which I've tweaked in some minor and major ways.  
It's not really in a state where I could publish it, but it's on GitHub for those interested.  
The blog itself has a [repo here](https://github.com/jemus42/blog.jemu.name).

## Support

If, for whatever reason, you feel like you would like to support me financially, here are your options:

- <i class='fa fa-paypal fa-lg'></i> [PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.me/jemus42) (one-time)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jemus42) (monthly)

I don't really have any reason to ask for support, but sometimes it comes up, so I'd just like to give you options.
