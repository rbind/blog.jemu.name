I'm Lukas, or jemus[42], or jemsu, or whatever.  
It depends on when you got to know me. Or where.  
My home on the internet used to be my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jemus42), which I abandoned in August '18 (but am still kind of using? It's complicated). There have been a lot of other places, but it appears that Twitter is the only hellhole I can't escape. Send help.

## This Site

This blog is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), using ~~[my fork](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-redlounge-jemsu) of the [Red Lounge theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/redlounge/) which I've tweaked in some minor and major ways.  
It's not really in a state where I could publish it, but it's on GitHub for those interested.~~~

I've switched to [beautifulhugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo), which is the closest to a complete theme for my particular needs I've found (and I've tried *a lot of themes*). I still overrode a lot of elements of the theme via CSS (hackily) or overruled layout templates (similiarly shoddily), and I guess I'm slowly getting there. Still not happy with it though, but as long as I don't have time to dig deeper into Hugo templates it'll have to do. I just hope it doesn't completely break on me again with an upcoming Hugo update.

The blog itself has a [repo on rbind](https://github.com/rbind/blog.jemu.name).
