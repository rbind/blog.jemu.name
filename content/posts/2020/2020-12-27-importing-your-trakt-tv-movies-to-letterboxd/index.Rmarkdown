```

Every once in a while I'm reminded that [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) exists, and it's more popular for movies than my beloved [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv).
While my Plex-based setup can auto-scrobble movies to trakt, it can't do the same for letterboxd, so unless I manually check in and rate movies over there, it's not going to happen.  
Unless I can automate it, which is at least in some sense possible thanks to letterboxd's [import options](https://letterboxd.com/import/) where you can just chuck in a CSV file of your watched movies including your rating. 
Looking at [its documentation](https://letterboxd.com/about/importing-data/), I realized that shouldn't be too hard to reproduce using my {{< pkg "tRakt" >}} package to get my data out of trakt and into letterboxd, so here goes.

```{r}
library(tRakt)
library(dplyr)

rated_movies <- user_ratings(user = "jemus42", type = "movies")

# whittle down for the importer
rated_movies <- rated_movies %>%
  select(
    Title = title,
    imdbID = imdb,
    rating10 = rating
  )
```

Now I have my ratings, but to fill out the diary entries with corresponding dates I need the  `WatchedDate` column --- I don't particularly care about having a complete / accurate movie watching history on both trakt _and_ letterboxd, but it's easy enough to get via the trakt API:

```{r}
watched_movies <- user_watched(
  user = "jemus42",
  type = "movies"
)
```

Now just join the two datasets and here we go.  
If you've previously done this, you may want to `filter` to select entries younger than a certain date to avoid duplicates.

```{r}
watched_movies %>%
  select(
    WatchedDate = last_watched_at,
    Title = title,
    imdbID = imdb
  ) %>%
  mutate(WatchedDate = as.Date(WatchedDate)) %>%
  left_join(rated_movies, by = c("imdbID", "Title")) %>%
  arrange(WatchedDate) %>%
  filter(WatchedDate >= as.Date("2020-12-27")) %>%
  readr::write_csv(
    file = "trakt-movies-letterboxd.csv",
    quote_escape = "backslash"
  )
```
